<h1>Book Recommendation System (Python)</h1>

<h2>1. Project Overview</h2>

This project is a command-line based Book Recommendation System developed in Python. It enables users to explore books categorized across multiple genres. Each genre includes a curated list of books along with their respective authors. The system uses a menu-driven structure that supports easy navigation, clear interaction, and clean output formatting.

<h2>2. Features</h2>

* Menu-driven command-line interface.
* Multiple genres including fiction, non-fiction, fantasy, thriller, biography, poetry, philosophy, and more.
* Each genre contains four to five books with author names.
* Option to view all books across all genres.
* User input validation to ensure stable program execution.
* Structured and modular code design for readability and future expansion.

<h2>3. Technologies Used</h2>

Python 3.x

Standard Python library only (no external dependencies)

<h2>4. Project Structure</h2>
BOOK-RECOMENDATION-SYSTEM/
│── book_recommendation_system.py     # Main program file
│── README.md                         # Project documentation

<h2>5. How to Run the Program</h2>
Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository

Using Git:https://github.com/mayanksharma0070/BOOK-RECOMENDATION-SYSTEM/blob/main/book_recommendation_system.py

Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

Step 2: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

Navigate to the project directory:

cd BOOK-RECOMENDATION-SYSTEM

Step 3: Execute the Python Script

Use the following command:

python book_recommendation_system.py


or

python3 book_recommendation_system.py

<h2>6. Implementation Approach</h2>

The program uses a nested dictionary structure where each genre is mapped to a list of books represented as dictionaries containing the book title and author.
The code follows a modular programming approach, with dedicated functions for displaying genres, showing recommendations, listing all books, and handling the main menu.
Input validation ensures incorrect user choices do not affect program stability.
The structure was designed with scalability in mind, allowing additional genres, books, or new features to be integrated easily.

<h2>7. Key Learnings</h2>

Effective use of Python data structures such as dictionaries and lists for managing structured information.
Application of functional decomposition to create modular, reusable, and readable code.
Understanding of menu-driven application design and user interaction handling.
Development of input validation and error-checking mechanisms.
Experience in creating clear and organized project documentation.

<h2>8. Future Enhancements</h2>
Integration of a graphical user interface (GUI).
Implementation of advanced recommendation algorithms based on user preferences.
Storage of book data in external files (JSON, CSV) or a database system.
Addition of search functionality for book titles and authors.
Support for downloading or updating book data from external sources.
